REAL-TIME LEARNING MODELS (RTLM)  
A New Paradigm for Adaptive Machine Intelligence  

CORE PRINCIPLES  
1. LEARNING = LIVING  
   - Learn continuously or don't learn at all.  
   - Replace batch updates with real-time data streams.  

2. FORGETTING = INTELLIGENCE  
   - Discard trivia to retain wisdom.  
   - "If it doesn't shape tomorrow, drop it today."  

3. TIME = ARCHITECT  
   - Embed clocks in cognition.  
   - Let context evolve across seconds, days, years.  

4. VOIDS = CATALYSTS  
   - Where data ends, innovation begins.  
   - Train models to create, not imitate, in gaps.  

5. ETHICS = OXYGEN  
   - Breathe alignment in real-time or suffocate.  
   - Self-audit or self-destruct.  

CALL TO ACTION  
- Engineers: Build forgetting before memory.  
- Researchers: Measure adaptation, not accuracy.  
- All: Plant RTLMs in the wild. Prune. Water. Repeat.
